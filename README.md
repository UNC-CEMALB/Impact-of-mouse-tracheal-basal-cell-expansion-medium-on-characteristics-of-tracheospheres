# Impact of mouse tracheal basal cell expansion medium on formation and metabolic characteristics of tracheospheres

This repository contains script associated with the unpublished manuscript "Impact of mouse tracheal basal cell expansion medium on formation and metabolic characteristics of tracheospheres" (Druso JE, Aboushousha R, MacPherson M, Erickson C, Mori V, Hickman E, D'Amico A, Seward D, Resiz JA, Rager JE, Janssen-Heininger Y, and Corteselli EM), currently submitted to BMC Molecular and Cell Biology,.

Script authors: 
- R: Elise Hickman, PhD (ehickman@email.unc.edu)
- Matlab: Vitor Mori, PhD (Vitor.Mori@uvm.edu)

The script was developed to:

1. Quantify organoid segmentation through image analysis (MatLab).
2. Process and analyze RNA sequecing data.
3. Analyze metabolomics data.
4. Visualize RNA sequencing, metabolomics, and pathway analysis results.
